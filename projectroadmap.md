## MS Paint in Python - Project Roadmap

**Phase 1: Core Drawing Functionality**

* [X] Test out the github repository I found and see if it fits my use case
      - Tested out a similiar github repo and it is a good starting point for what I wnat to do
* [X] Set up basic window and canvas using a suitable Python GUI library (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, Pygame)
* [X] Implement freehand drawing with a basic brush tool
* [X] Allow changing brush color
* [X] Implement basic shape drawing (lines, rectangles, ovals)
* [X] Implement color palette selection
* [X] Implement a clear canvas function
* [X] Basic saving functionality (saving the canvas as an image file - e.g., PNG)
* [X] Basic opening functionality (loading an image file onto the canvas)
* [X] The pen tool is not working and make a filled in shape

**Phase 2: Essential Tools and Features**

* [X] Implement an eraser tool
* [ ] Implement a fill tool (flood fill)
* [ ] Implement a selection tool (rectangular selection)
* [ ] Implement copy and paste functionality for selections
* [ ] Implement resizing of shapes after drawing (if feasible at this stage)
* [X] Implement undo/redo functionality (basic level)
* [X] Add a basic toolbar or menu for tool selection
* [ ] Display current brush color and size

**Phase 3: Advanced Tools and Enhancements**

* [ ] Implement different brush styles and sizes
* [ ] Implement polygon drawing tool
* [ ] Implement text tool with font and size options
* [ ] Implement image resizing and cropping
* [ ] Implement rotation of selections/images
* [ ] Enhance undo/redo functionality (multiple levels)
* [ ] Add more sophisticated color manipulation tools (e.g., eyedropper)
* [ ] Explore different image file formats for saving/opening (e.g., JPEG, GIF)

**Phase 4: User Interface and Polish**

* [ ] Improve the layout and design of the toolbar/menu
* [ ] Add tooltips for buttons and options
* [ ] Implement zoom in/out functionality
* [ ] Add grid or ruler options
* [ ] Implement more advanced selection tools (e.g., free-form selection)
* [ ] Thorough testing and bug fixing
* [ ] Documentation of the project and code

**Future Considerations (Optional)**

* [ ] Layer support
* [ ] Filters and effects
* [ ] Animation capabilities
* [ ] Integration with external libraries
