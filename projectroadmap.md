## MS Paint in Python - Project Roadmap

**Phase 1: Core Drawing Functionality**

* [ ] Set up basic window and canvas using a suitable Python GUI library (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, Pygame)
* [ ] Implement freehand drawing with a basic brush tool
* [ ] Allow changing brush color
* [ ] Implement basic shape drawing (lines, rectangles, ovals)
* [ ] Implement color palette selection
* [ ] Implement a clear canvas function
* [ ] Basic saving functionality (saving the canvas as an image file - e.g., PNG)
* [ ] Basic opening functionality (loading an image file onto the canvas)

**Phase 2: Essential Tools and Features**

* [ ] Implement an eraser tool
* [ ] Implement a fill tool (flood fill)
* [ ] Implement a selection tool (rectangular selection)
* [ ] Implement copy and paste functionality for selections
* [ ] Implement resizing of shapes after drawing (if feasible at this stage)
* [ ] Implement undo/redo functionality (basic level)
* [ ] Add a basic toolbar or menu for tool selection
* [ ] Display current brush color and size

**Phase 3: Advanced Tools and Enhancements**

* [ ] Implement different brush styles and sizes
* [ ] Implement polygon drawing tool
* [ ] Implement text tool with font and size options
* [ ] Implement image resizing and cropping
* [ ] Implement rotation of selections/images
* [ ] Enhance undo/redo functionality (multiple levels)
* [ ] Add more sophisticated color manipulation tools (e.g., eyedropper)
* [ ] Explore different image file formats for saving/opening (e.g., JPEG, GIF)

**Phase 4: User Interface and Polish**

* [ ] Improve the layout and design of the toolbar/menu
* [ ] Add tooltips for buttons and options
* [ ] Implement zoom in/out functionality
* [ ] Add grid or ruler options
* [ ] Implement more advanced selection tools (e.g., free-form selection)
* [ ] Thorough testing and bug fixing
* [ ] Documentation of the project and code

**Future Considerations (Optional)**

* [ ] Layer support
* [ ] Filters and effects
* [ ] Animation capabilities
* [ ] Integration with external libraries

**Notes:**

* This is a suggested roadmap and can be adjusted based on your priorities and progress.
* Feel free to break down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.
* Regularly review and update this roadmap as the project evolves.
* Use GitHub Issues to track specific bugs and feature requests.
* Consider using GitHub Projects or Milestones to organize your work within these phases.
